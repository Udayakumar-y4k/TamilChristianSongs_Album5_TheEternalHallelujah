This song of humble petition echoes Solomon’s request in 1 Kings 3:5–14 — choosing wisdom over wealth or long life. It calls the believer to seek God’s holy wisdom above all earthly things, to let His Word fill the heart, to build His temple (our lives), and to proclaim His righteousness. True wisdom comes from Christ alone — the hidden treasures of wisdom and knowledge (Colossians 2:3).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, Wisdom of God and Treasure of all knowledge,
grant us wisdom as You granted Solomon — not for self, but for Your glory.
Fill our hearts with Your Word.
Let us walk in righteousness and proclaim Your truth.
Exalt us as head, not tail, in Your kingdom.
Come quickly, and let Your eternal hallelujah resound in every wise heart.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
