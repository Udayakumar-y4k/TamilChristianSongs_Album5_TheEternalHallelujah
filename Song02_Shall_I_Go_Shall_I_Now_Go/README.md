This song of divine guidance echoes David’s repeated inquiry of the Lord (1 Samuel 23:2–4, 30:8) — “Shall I go up…?” — and Jonah’s redirection to Nineveh despite his flight. It calls the believer to ask God first, trust His counsel, and walk in obedience — for the Lord makes His own the head, not the tail (Deuteronomy 28:13), exalting them in His time.
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, Wonderful Counselor and Guide,
teach us to inquire of You before every step.
When we are uncertain — “Shall I go?” — speak clearly.
Make us the head and not the tail in Your kingdom.
Lead us in paths of righteousness for Your name’s sake.
Come quickly, and let Your eternal hallelujah fill every heart.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
