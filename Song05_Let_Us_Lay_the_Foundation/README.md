This triumphant song of restoration echoes the rebuilding of the temple in Ezra 3–6 and Haggai/Zechariah — the foundation laid with praise and tears, Cyrus’ decree, Darius’ confirmation, and God’s promise that His glory will fill the house (Haggai 2:9). It calls the remnant to arise, build God’s spiritual temple (our lives and the church) in Jesus’ name, raise walls of righteousness, and exalt Him forever — for He is the true foundation (1 Corinthians 3:11).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, Chief Cornerstone and living Temple,
help us lay the foundation of our lives in Your name.
Raise us up to build Your spiritual house with righteousness.
Let Your glory fill us as You promised.
Make us a dwelling place for Your Spirit.
Come quickly, and let Your eternal hallelujah resound in every rebuilt heart.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
