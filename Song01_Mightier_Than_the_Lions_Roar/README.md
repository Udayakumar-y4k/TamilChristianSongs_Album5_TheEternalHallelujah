This triumphant song of resurrection power draws from Isaiah 40:31 (mount up with wings like eagles) and Amos 3:8 (the lion has roared), proclaiming Jesus as mightier than every force of darkness. It calls the remnant to arise in faith, unsheathe the sword of the Spirit (God’s Word), and proclaim victory — even when weapons fail and warriors fall. The Lord shines in His sanctuary, and the faithful triumph through Him.
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, Lion of Judah and Morning Star,
mightier than every roar, swifter than every flight,
give us strength to arise in Your power.
Arm us with Your Word as our sword.
Let us proclaim victory in the midst of battle.
Come quickly, and let Your eternal hallelujah resound.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
