This majestic song of divine descent and power draws from multiple biblical moments of God’s manifest presence: the thunder and wind at Pentecost filling the believers, the voice from heaven glorifying the Son, the thunderous glory on Sinai, the mighty voice in Psalm 29, and the seven thunders in Revelation. It proclaims Jesus as the One who comes with thunderous might, fills His people with the Holy Spirit, calms every storm, and adorns the heavens with His glory. The song calls the remnant to stand in awe and welcome His coming in radiant power and grace.
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, who descends with thunder and fills with Your Spirit’s might,
come in glory as You did at Pentecost — with fire, wind, and power.
Calm every storm in our lives with Your commanding voice.
Adorn us with Your glory as You adorn the heavens.
Let Your presence thunder through our hearts and fill us anew.
Come quickly, with the sound of many waters and the shout of triumph.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
